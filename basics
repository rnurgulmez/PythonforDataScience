***  Variables  ***

x=2 #int  assigning 2 to x,assigning value
y=5 #int 
# Python is a dynamically typed language,you don't need to specify the type of variable,whatever content you are assigning to a variable the that content decides the type.
xy=7.2 #float
# We need to assign the names of the variables descriptive way for readability.
c=2+4j #complex
s="hellow" #string 
# Double quotes or single quotes no difference between them.
# String is a sequance of characthers
s="12" #string
a,b=4,5.0 #mutliple assignment #a is a int #b is a float because of the decimal points
# Each variable keeps a space in memory. To free this space, we delete the variables we no longer use from the memory with this command.
del x 
print("x") #error
# We can see how many variable that we have rn in the memory with this command
%whos
x=5 #int
x=5.7 #float it changed now
print(type(x)) #<class 'int'>

***  Operators  ***


+ addition           // floor or integer division (10//3=3 just quotient)
- subtraction        ** to the power of
/ division
% mod (27%5=2)
* multiplication

# tab completion
# esc m to markdown
# shift enter to new cell
# float > integer so 6+3.2= float
# if you don't assign your variable anywhere like you code directly like 10/3 it is assigning to _(underscore) by default
# underscore is contains most recent variable or operator that we've created
# we shouldn't assign anything to _ because we can't use python built in proparties properly
# we can start with a underscore when we named the variables but nothing else
# camelNotation

***  Type Bool and Comparisons  ***

# bool = True,False
# and(binary operator it takes two),or,not(unary operator it just takes one variable)
not(True) = False
# only one equal sign means assignment =,two equal sign means we are checking wheter the two values are equal or not ==
# != not equal the result is true if the two variables are different from each other

!!! 3==3.0  TRUE !!!
# because they are comparing the values by discarding the decimal points.
# int gets implicitly converted to float in this case.

***  Some Useful Functions  ***

# Functions are sometimes,particularly a built in function is basically a feature form the language that is supplied for users to achieve particular task.

* Round Function *

# Round functios finds the nearest integer
# round(4.6)=5  round is a Function 4.6 is a "argument"
# round(4.3)=4  round is a Function 4.3 is a "argument"
# round(4.55842,3) 4.558 the result will be there decimal places

* Divmod Function *

  divmod(x,y)  = (quotient,reminder)
# divmod(27,5) = (5,2) if we have 2 or more elements we call these "tuples" ordered list
# divmod = (//,%) is the same thing

* isinstance Function *

# Returns True if the first argument is an instance of that class. Multiple classes can also be checked at once. 
# print(isinstance(1,int))   True
# print(isinstance(1.0,int)) False
# print(isinstance(1.0,(int,float))) if it is one of these returns True

* Power Function *

# pow(x,y,z) = x raise to the power y and remainder by z (x**y)%z
# pow(2,4,7) = 2 -> 2**4=16%7=2

* Input Function *

# a= input("Enter something") whatever the user enter here it is string even if 34 it is also string we will convert afterwards.
x=input("enter a number : ")
type(x) -> str
x = int(x) 
type(x) -> int we converted str to int

a = float(input("Enter a real number : "))

# pow?,pow??,help(pow),help(input) we can check like this how can we use one function

***  Control Flow  ***
if b>a:
  print("b is greater than a")
else:
  print("a is greater than b")

------------

a = int(input())
b = int(input())
if a>b:
    print("a is greater than b,a and b:",a,b)
elif a==b:
    print("a and b are equal,a and b:",a,b)
else:
    print("b is greater than a,a and b:",a,b)

------Short Form of If Else-------

a=9
b=10
print("A") if a>b else print("=") if a==b else print("B")

--------Calculating Grade----------

a = int(input("Enter Marks: "))
if a>=85:
    print("A grade")
elif (a>=80) and (a<85):
    print("A- grade")
elif (a>=75) and (a<80):
    print("B grade")
elif (a>=70) and (a<75):
    print("B- grade")
else:
    print("Below Avarage")

-------Fun Part-------------

a = 3
if a>10:
    print(">10")
elif not(a>10):
    print("else part")

* Nested If *

x = int(input("Enter a number : "))
if x>10:
    print("your number is greater than ten, ")
    if x>20:
        print("and also above 20!")
    else:
        print("but not above 20.")

User will enter a floating number let say 238.915. Your task is to find 
out the integer portion before the point (in this case 238)
and then check if that integer portion is an even number or not.

x = float(input("Enter a floating number : "))
y = round(x)
if x>0:
    if y>x:
        intPortion = y-1
    else:
        intPortion = y
else:
    if y>x: 
        intPortion = y
    else:
        intPortion = y+1

!! if :
   else :
     pass (=do nothing)

if intPortion%2 == 0:
    print("even")
else:
    print("odd")

***  Loops  ***
n = int(input("How many times should I repeat? :"))
i=1
while i<n:
    print(i)
    i+=1
print("done")

* Break Continue *

# A break statement wherever written inside the body of the loop tells that exit the loop immediately 
# whenver this break encountered,it exits the loop and brings you outside of the loop.

# Continue basically skips the remaining body of the loop and starts another iteration.
